# Editorial 10/2022

In English:

After an unfortunately inactive spring and early autumn, it is finally time for Huhuu to make its comeback! After last summer our team has returned to work and is cooking up new content for our readers. The dynamic of our group is slightly different from what it was before: last year’s abis have now graduated and therefore also moved on from Huhuu. Luckily we’ve had some new members join us and will still gladly be taking in people along the way. With the changes in our group, our old editors in chief will also be replaced and from now on, we are taking the lead!

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!
